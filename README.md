## About the Partner Organization
The [Antara Foundation](http://www.antarafoundation.org/) works on maternal and child health and nutrition, in partnership with the government of Rajasthan. This entails that we havenâ€™t instituted any parallel system of service delivery but work on strengthening existing system, for benefits to be sustainable. This is done by improving 
- skills of frontline workers 
- infrastructure, equipment and supplies at facilities, among other interventions.
