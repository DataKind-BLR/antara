## About the Partner Organization
The [Antara Foundation](http://www.antarafoundation.org/) works on maternal and child health and nutrition, in partnership with the government of Rajasthan. This entails that we havenâ€™t instituted any parallel system of service delivery but work on strengthening existing system, for benefits to be sustainable. This is done by improving 
- skills of frontline workers 
- infrastructure, equipment and supplies at facilities, among other interventions.

## Background
They primarily work in Jhalawar and Baran districts of Rajasthan, each of which is divided into 6-7 blocks. Each block has around 50 health sub-centres, catering to around 200 villages.  Services are provided at the grassroots by 3 women; Auxillary Nurse and Midwife (ANM), at the Sub Centre level, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and Anganwadi Worker (AWW) at the village level. Please refer to our website for detailed information on our work, focussing on our flagship Akshada program.

## Scope
[DataKindBLR](http://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-blr) has partnered with Antara to help build a custom data dashboard in our 2017 Sprint(April-June) to better track maternal and child health indicators ideally on a district map by:
* Developing easily readable snapshots of one time data
  * Eg. Profiles of Health sub-centres on infrastructure, utilities, equipment and suppl
    * Classify sub centers as per pre-defined indicators
    * Sub center Gap analysis (needs to be defined)
    * Update on higher risk pregnancies (according to a formula)
* Developing easily readable and actionable dashboards to track changes in periodically updated data
  * Eg. Dynamic dashboards tracking change across 5 indicators (updated monthly) for select sub-centres    
 
## Approach
* We have recieved detailed data dictionary from Antara and would work on a dummy data for the scope of this collaboration.
* We are working to generate village boundaries for Rajasthan so that we can visualize these indicators on Map.
* We would be working to fork another DataKind Project, [CBGA Story Generator](https://github.com/cbgaindia/story-generator) and furbish for our scope in subsequent weekends.

## Development Setup:
* **Clone this repository.** - `git clone https://github.com/DataKind-BLR/antara.git` or [download the zip](https://github.com/DataKind-BLR/antara.git)
